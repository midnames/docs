Fields (also called records) are key-value metadata attached to your `.night` domain. They let you store information like a display name, bio, social links, avatar URL, and more — all on-chain and queryable by anyone through the SDK.

## Common fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Display name shown on your profile |
| `bio` | Short description or bio text |
| `website` | Your website URL |
| `twitter` | Twitter/X handle (without `@`) |
| `github` | GitHub username |
| `avatar` | URL to your profile picture |
| `epk` | Your `EncryptionPublicKey` — set automatically on registration |
| `location` | Your location |

You can also add any custom field you like. Field names are case-insensitive.

<Aside type="note" title="epk field">
  The `epk` field is set automatically when you register a domain. When both `epk` and a resolved target are present, the widget derives your shielded address (`mn_shield-addr_test...`) instead of showing the raw `ZswapCoinPublicKey`.
</Aside>

## How fields are used

Fields appear on your domain profile at <a href="https://preprod.midnames.com" target="_blank">preprod.midnames.com</a> and in any app that uses the `DomainProfileWidget` or calls `getDomainFields` from the SDK.

The widget automatically reads these fields to populate the profile card — for example, `avatar` sets the profile picture, `bio` fills the bio section, and `twitter`/`github`/`website` render as social link chips.

## Managing fields

To add, edit, or remove fields, go to <a href="https://preprod.midnames.com" target="_blank">preprod.midnames.com</a>, search for your domain, and click **Customize & Advanced**. From there you can:

- **Add fields** — enter a field name and value, then click the add button. You can add multiple fields at once.
- **Edit fields** — change the value of an existing field in the input.
- **Remove fields** — clear the value (leave it empty) to remove a field.

Click the update button when you're done. Your Lace wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction.

<Aside type="caution" title="10-field limit per transaction">
  You can update a maximum of **10 fields per transaction**. If you need to update more, submit multiple transactions.
</Aside>

## Reading fields with the SDK

```typescript
import { getDomainFields } from "@midnames/sdk";

const result = await getDomainFields("facu.night");
if (result.success) {
  for (const [key, value] of result.data) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
  }
}
```

See the [SDK reference](/reference/resolve/#getdomainfields) for full details.
